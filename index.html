  <h2>Featured Cybersecurity Projects</h2>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Post-Incident Malware Analysis & Fileless Attack Simulation</h3>
    <p>
      Analyzed a malicious Windows Portable Executable (PE) using static and dynamic techniques to identify evasion methods, persistence mechanisms, and covert remote access behavior. Simulated a real-world fileless attack using PowerShell to establish an in-memory reverse shell, demonstrating modern attacker tradecraft and post-exploitation persistence.

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Multi-Stage Ransomware Attack Chain Simulation</h3>
    <p>
      Developed and executed a controlled malware simulation implementing a full modern ransomware attack chain in a lab environment. The malware disguised itself as a legitimate OBS Studio installer, performed privilege escalation, payload deployment, persistence mechanisms, and created a hidden administrative backdoor. The project concluded with automated ransom note delivery and self-deletion of the dropper to reduce forensic artifacts, demonstrating practical understanding of malware behavior, persistence, and evasion techniques.

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Web Application Penetration Testing – DVWA</h3>
    <p>
      Conducted a hands-on penetration test against the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA), exploiting vulnerabilities such as command injection, insecure file uploads, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS). Demonstrated real-world impact through reverse shells, credential extraction, and session cookie exfiltration, highlighting practical offensive security skills and secure coding awareness.

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Enterprise Security Risk Assessment</h3>
    <p>
      Performed a comprehensive security assessment of enterprise workstations using both uncredentialed and credentialed vulnerability scans. Identified and analyzed critical and medium-risk exposures, providing actionable recommendations to harden configurations and reduce overall organizational risk.
